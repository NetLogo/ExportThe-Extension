# Export-The

## What is it?

A NetLogo extension for getting some special NetLogo values as strings, rather than writing them out to files.

The results of `export-the:world` and `export-the:view` can be easily re-imported later with the Import-A extension (i.e. `import-a:world` and `import-a:drawing`).

## Primitives

| Prim Name | Arguments  | Behavior
| --------- | ---------- | --------
| `model`   |            | Returns a string with the contents of the `.nlogo` file that would be generated by saving this model.  Throws an error if called when running NetLogo headlessly.
| `output`  |            | Returns a string with the contents of the file that would be generated by [`export-output`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#export-output).
| `plot`    | *plotName* | Returns a string with the contents of the file that would be generated by [`export-plot`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#export-plot) (except for the interface global data).  Throws an error if no plot with the name given by *plotName* exists.
| `view`    |            | Returns a string of the base64-encoded contents of the file that would be generated by [`export-view`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#export-view).
| `world`   |            | Returns a string with the contents of the file that would be generated by [`export-world`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#export-world).

## Building

Open it in SBT.  If you successfully run `package`, `export-the.jar` is created.
