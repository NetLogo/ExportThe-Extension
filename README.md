# Export-The

## What is it?

A NetLogo extension for getting some special NetLogo values as strings, rather than writing them out to files.

The results of `export-the:world` and `export-the:view` can be easily re-imported later with the Import-A extension (i.e. `import-a:world` and `import-a:drawing`).

## Primitives

| Prim Name | Arguments  | Behavior
| --------- | ---------- | --------
| `model`   |            | Returns a string with the contents of the `.nlogo` file that would be generated by saving this model.  Throws an error if called when running NetLogo headlessly.
| `output`  |            | Returns a string with the contents of the file that would be generated by [`export-output`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#export-output).
| `plot`    | *plotName* | Returns a string with the contents of the file that would be generated by [`export-plot`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#export-plot) (except for the interface global data).  Throws an error if no plot with the name given by *plotName* exists.
| `view`    |            | Returns a string of the base64-encoded contents of the file that would be generated by [`export-view`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#export-view).
| `world`   |            | Returns a string with the contents of the file that would be generated by [`export-world`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#export-world).


## I tried running a primitive and printing it out to the Command Center, and now NetLogo is super slow!  What happened?!

When exporting data with this extension, it is entirely possible that the exported string will end up being very large.  The NetLogo Command Center does not take well to printing out very large strings, and will likely slow to a crawl if given one.  However, do note that you can speed NetLogo back up again by clicking the "Clear" button next to the Command Center output window, thereby disposing of the enormously long string (and all other strings in the Command Center).

## Building

Open it in SBT.  If you successfully run `package`, `export-the.jar` is created.
